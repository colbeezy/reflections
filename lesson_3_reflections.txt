When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you're working on a project with multiple people or from multiple computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case somehow the remote gets wacky, you can choose to keep the local version that you have control over.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
clone = copy of a repo. fork = clone on github with some special functionality that allows you to associate the fork with the orignal. branch = a copy within a repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If you're offline, you can basically download a copy of the remote even if you're not ready to handle the merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I wouldn't; I would quit coding. But if I had to, there would be a lot of saving and sending around files. I wouldn't have had to take this class, but the lack of flexibility would suck.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When I'm trying a new feature or experimental design or collaborating with others. If you want to go faster, work in master. If you want to go farther, use branches as necessary :)
