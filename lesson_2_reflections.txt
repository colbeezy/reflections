What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git version control begins for that directory (or parts of it).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area lets us prepare one file at a time to be ready for a commit... working directory is more fluid
