How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Using diff to compare two files
helped me see which lines had been added
and which had been removed.
It's easier for a computer to do it than a pleb human.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Makes it easier to find when bugs were introduced, how features have been modifie,d etc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
In Git less gets committed than Google Docs, but you're in control of making those commits logical.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is code-based and has primarily diff use cases than a version control system like Google docs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log lets you see all commits and git diff lets you compare changes between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I always know I can go back to an earlier version of history when I hadn't broken the thing!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
building an app!
